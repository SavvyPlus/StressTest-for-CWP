# StressTest-for-CWP
We need to perform a stress test for CWP Renewables for their wind farm in NSW. The spot price may be adjusted up to the maximum of $14,200/MWh and the Cumulative Price Threshold (sum of the previous 7 days) cannot exceed the maximum (7.5 x $14,200). Under these situations, we derive the weekly revenue payments for 2019 simulations with wind generation in Sapphire Wind Farm.
